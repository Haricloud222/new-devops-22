In the context of a Kubernetes Service, the targetPort specifies the port on the pods to which traffic will be forwarded. Let's break down the key components:

port: This is the port at which the service will be exposed. In your example, the service will be exposed on port 80 externally.

targetPort: This is the port on the pods to which the traffic will be sent within the cluster. In your example, the traffic received on port 80 on the service will be forwarded to port 8080 on the pods.

nodePort: This is the port that is exposed on each node of the cluster. If you specify nodePort: 31000, it means that the service will be externally accessible on each node at port 31000. This is optional, and if you don't specify it, Kubernetes will automatically assign a nodePort within a specific range (default is 30000-32767).

So, in summary, when a request comes to the external port 80, the service forwards that request to the pods on their port 8080. The nodePort allows you to expose this service on a specific port on each node. When accessing the service externally, you would use the IP of any node in your cluster and the specified nodePort (e.g., http://<node-ip>:31000).
